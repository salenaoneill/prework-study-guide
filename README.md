# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation for creating this website was to learn more about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript before my coding boot camp begins. It will also give me a platform to take some notes on what I have so far learned. Building the website was a great introduction to tools & languages that I will be learning more about in the near future!
